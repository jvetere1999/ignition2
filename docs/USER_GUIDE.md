### XP and Levels

Everything you do earns XP (experience points):

- Completing quests: Variable

XP accumulates to increase your level. Each level requires progressively more XP.

### Coins

### Skills

Your XP is distributed across five skills (Persona 5 style):
- **Knowledge** - Learning and focus activities
- **Guts** - Exercise and challenging tasks
- **Proficiency** - Production and creative work
- **Kindness** - Community activities
- **Charm** - Social and presentation skills

### Streaks

Maintain daily streaks for habits, focus, and workouts. Purchase "Streak Shields" from the Market to protect your streaks if you miss a day.
