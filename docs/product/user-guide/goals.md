# Goals

Set and track long-term objectives with milestones.

## Creating Goals

1. Go to **Goals**
2. Click "Add Goal"
3. Fill in details:
   - **Title** - Goal name

   - **Category** - Health, Career, Personal, Creative, Financial
   - **Deadline** - Target completion date
4. Add milestones (sub-tasks)
5. Click "Create"

## Milestones

Break goals into smaller steps:
- Each milestone is a checkbox
- Completing milestones updates progress
- Progress bar shows overall completion

Example:
- Goal: "Learn piano basics"
  - Milestone 1: "Learn C major scale"
  - Milestone 2: "Practice for 30 days"
  - Milestone 3: "Play a simple song"

## Categories

Organize goals by type:
- **Health** - Fitness and wellness
- **Career** - Professional development
- **Personal** - Self-improvement
- **Creative** - Artistic projects
- **Financial** - Money goals

## Completing Goals

When all milestones are done:
1. Goal marked as complete
2. Earn bonus XP (40 XP)
3. Earn coins (20 coins)

## Syncing

Goals sync across devices via D1:
- Create on desktop, view on mobile
- Progress updates in real-time
- Never lose your goals

## Tips

1. **Be specific** - "Lose 10 lbs" vs "Get healthy"
2. **Set deadlines** - Creates urgency
3. **Small milestones** - Keep momentum
4. **Review regularly** - Adjust as needed
