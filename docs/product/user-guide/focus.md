# Focus Timer

The Focus Timer helps you stay productive using the Pomodoro technique.

## How It Works

1. **Focus Session** (default: 25 minutes) - Deep work time
2. **Short Break** (default: 5 minutes) - Quick rest
3. **Long Break** (default: 15 minutes) - Extended rest after 4 focus sessions

## Starting a Session

1. Navigate to **Focus**
2. Choose your mode (Focus, Break, or Long Break)
3. Click "Start"
4. Work until the timer completes

## Controls

- **Start/Pause** - Begin or pause the timer
- **Reset** - Reset to the beginning of current mode
- **Skip** - Move to the next mode

## Customization

Adjust timer durations in **Settings**:
- Focus duration: 15-60 minutes
- Short break: 3-15 minutes
- Long break: 10-30 minutes

## Pausing & Cross-Device Sync

When you pause a session:
- State is saved automatically
- Resume on any device
- Paused sessions expire after 1 hour

## Rewards

Completing focus sessions earns:
- **25 XP** per session
- **10 coins** per session
- Progress toward focus-related quests

## Focus Indicator

The bottom bar shows your current focus status across all pages:

3. **Respect breaks** - Step away from the screen during breaks
4. **Track patterns** - Check Progress to see your focus trends
